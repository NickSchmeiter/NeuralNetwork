# NeuralNetwork
With this Project I try to use multiple Neural Network models for stock price prediction. 
I used RNN (Experiment 4 and 5), LSTM (Experiment 2 and 3) and multi input LSTM (Experiment 1) as models. 
I predicted for single stocks (Experiment 3 and 4) and multiple stocks (Experiment 1,2,5)
All models performed well with a loss in the last batch of the last epoch of 0.000 (Experiment 2 and 5) and 0.001 (Experiment 3 and 4)
Couldnt get model 1 to work even though took majority of my time
